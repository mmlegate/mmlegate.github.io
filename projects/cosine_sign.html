            <div class="text"> <h2>Cosine Sign Correlation</h2>
                <p>I was able to do research at UW in the Washington eXperimental Mathematics Lab (WXML) under the expert guidance of Professor Stefan Steinerberger. We were concerned with the coupling and decoupling of cosine functions of a particular form: <b>cos(ax)</b>, where <b>a</b> is some natural number. We determined how to choose 3 cosine coefficients such that all three functions share the same sign the minimum amount of time. </p>
                <p>The applications of this research lies primarily in quantum mechanics, as cosine functions are the building block of virtually all possible wavefunctions. The Hermite polynomials are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator, which can be used to model any potential well in a quantum system.</p> 
                <p><b>We are essentially proving that entanglement is an emergent property of the mathematical structures that describe quantum objects.</b></p>

                    <h4>Python</h4>
                    <i>Python is a versatile programming language, widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation, supported by a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</i>

                    <ul>
                        <li>While the formal proof is done on paper, and most mathematical discussion was verbal, Python was pivotal in the completion of our research.</li>
                        <li>Since <b>a</b>, the coefficient of a cosine function, can be an infinite amount of numbers, we were tasked of reducing <b>a</b>'s possible values by simply using the tricks of Fourier Analysis and other mathematics. Once we have a finite amount of coefficients, we can run those combinations in a computer to see which 3 coefficients share the sign the least amount of time.</li>
                        <li>We also mathematically modeled our research for a better understanding of the topological interpretation of cosine functions. This involved visual representations of cosine functions, plotted on a torus.</li>

                    <i>Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write, execute, and share code, while also using free GPU and TPU resources for machine learning and data analysis tasks.</i>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Since we used Python to compute the decoupling of various cosine functions, we found that Colab was the best way to host our code, and effectively . . . collaborate. </li>
                        <li>For a full tutorial on the research done in WXML, please see the notebook provided in my Github which is linked below.</li>
                        <li>Colab was most handy for displaying the visualizations of cosine functions in real-time, so we could topologically understand how two coefficients decoupled the cosine functions.</li>

                        <li>We constructed our formal proof via LaTex which is now published in the Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications, arXiv, and a few others.</li>
                        <li>Using LaTex, we formatted the presentation of our findings. We presented our research to fellow WXML members and other Math faculty at the UW.</li>

        <section id="result" class="result-section"> <h2>Area of Inquiry</h2>
            <div class="inquiry">
                Consider two cosine functions:
                <br><b>
                <div>f(x) = cos(ax)
                <br>
                g(x) = cox(bx)</div>
                <br></b>
                Where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are arbitrary integers. If we plot these two functions, we can see their coupling, or in this case how much and how long they are both positive/negative. That is our primary concern, for which values of <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> can we minimize the amount of time that these two functions share the same sign.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note that sinusoidal functions are infinite, and we expect two infinite functions to share the same sign about 50% of the time. Would you be surprised if I told you that this is not always the case?
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, let <b>a=1</b> and <b>b=3</b>:
                <br>

                </div>
                We can express infinite cosine functions in a finite manner by using the topological map of the torus. Moreover, we can further simplify this visualization by 'unwrapping' the torus like so and plotting the ratio of cosine angles.
