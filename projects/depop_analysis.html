            <div class="text"> <h2>Depop Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>A hobby I picked up over the last several months is reselling clothes I find at local thrift stores. The conduit of my small business is an app called Depop, a social e-commerce app with 42 million registered users (as of 2023).
                <br><br>
                What interests me most is Depop's overlapp with technology for optimizing user experience. This led me to building a convolutional neural network in attempts to predict the price that my items will sell at.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The first task was to obtain the data required from my shop, which unfortunately isn't easily accessed through Depop's features (e.g. Seller Stats). I used Python, specifically the selenium library, to scrape various information that I needed from each item.</li>
                        <li>Data acquired includes: item image, description, brand, size, price listed. </li>
                        <li>I do not condone further scraping of Depop, as this is against their terms of service, but we prevail in the name of science.</li>

                        <li>Pytorch was used to actually construct the neural network used to output a predicted price. It currently consists of four fully contected layers with one dropout layer, but further modifications to improve accuracy will be implemented. </li>
                        <li>Data preparation involved conversion of the item image into an RGB matrix, tokenizing the item description, and one-hot-encoding the size, brand, and price listed.</li>
                        <li>Using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) standard, the model is currently performing at 75% accuracy. My shop only contains about 500 sales, so as time goes on I should be able improve its accuracy with more sales and modifications.</li>

                        <li>Colab was also helpful for creating visualizations of model performance, note that in the images displayed below there are certain factors that may hinder performance: the changing background for my modeling of items, the inconsistent angle of the camera, etc.</li>

                <br>
                <p>Above is an example of an item container that was scraped for information. Note that items contain more images in their individual posts, but for now the CNN only has access to the 'top' image, the first image that users will see when scrolling through Depop.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Below is the testing results on the last batch:</p>

                <img src="/../images/depop_nn_performance.webp" alt="Comparison of neural network output and source image">
            </div>
            <p>Depop only contains a limited amount of brand tags for each item, so if an item's brand is unlisted, it falls into the 'Other' category. Unfortunately, I believe this leads to a gap of necessary information for the CNN which attributes the large discrepancy on several items. Above, the white dress falls under the 'Other' category, which is the worst prediction in the test set. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We see below that there is some overfitting, and the validation accuracy is rather stable over the course of the training.</p>
